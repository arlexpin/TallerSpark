The Coca-Cola Company* expects all of its employees to comply
with the law and act ethically in all matters. We have the same
expectations of our suppliers. Our Code of Business Conduct
sets the basic standards for employee conduct. This Code of
Business Conduct for Suppliers establishes related requirements
for our suppliers. Working together, we can achieve great
success by doing the right thing.


Note: This Code contains general requirements applicable
to all suppliers to The Coca-Cola Company. Particular
supplier contracts may contain more specific provisions
addressing some of these same issues. Nothing in this
Code is meant to supersede any more specific provision
in a particular contract, and to the extent there is any
inconsistency between this Code and any other provision
of a particular contract, the other provision will control.


Conflicts of Interest

Employees of The Coca-Cola Company should act in the
best interest of the Company. Accordingly, employees
should have no relationship, financial or otherwise, with
any supplier that might conflict, or appear to conflict, with
the employee’s obligation to act in the best interest of The
Coca-Cola Company. For example, suppliers should not
employ or otherwise make payments to any employee of The
Coca-Cola Company during the course of any transaction
between the supplier and the Company. Friendships outside
of the course of business are inevitable and acceptable, but
suppliers should take care that any personal relationship is
not used to influence the Coca-Cola employee’s business
judgment. If a supplier employee is a family relation (spouse,
parent, sibling, grandparent, child, grandchild, mother- or
father-in-law, or same or opposite sex domestic partner) to
an employee of The Coca-Cola Company, or if a supplier has
any other relationship with an employee of The Coca-Cola
Company that might represent a conflict of interest, the
supplier should disclose this fact to The Coca-Cola Company
or ensure that the Coca-Cola employee does so.


Gifts, Meals and Entertainment


Employees of The Coca-Cola Company are prohibited from
accepting anything more than modest gifts, meals and
entertainment from suppliers. Ordinary business meals and
small tokens of appreciation such as gift baskets at holiday time
generally are fine, but suppliers should avoid offering Coca-Cola
employees travel, frequent meals or expensive gifts. Gifts of
cash or cash equivalents, such as gift cards, are never allowed.


- This document is applicable to suppliers of The Coca-Cola Company
and its majority-owned subsidiaries. Use of the terms “The Coca-Cola
Company” and “the Company” in this document refers to The Coca-Cola
Company or one or more of its subsidiaries, whichever is relevant to the
particular supplier relationship .

accurate records of all matters related to the supplier’s business
with The Coca-Cola Company. This includes the proper recording
of all expenses and payments. If The Coca-Cola Company is
being charged for a supplier employee’s time, time records must
be complete and accurate. Suppliers should not delay sending
an invoice or otherwise enable the shifting of an expense to a
different accounting period.


Bribery

Suppliers acting on behalf of The Coca-Cola Company must
comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well
as all local laws dealing with bribery of government officials.
In connection with any transaction as a supplier to The
Coca-Cola Company, or that otherwise involves The Coca-Cola
Company, the supplier must not transfer anything of value,
directly or indirectly, to any government official, employee of
a government-controlled company, or political party, in order
to obtain any improper benefit or advantage. Suppliers must
keep a written accounting of all payments (including any gifts,
meals, entertainment or anything else of value) made on behalf
of The Coca-Cola Company, or out of funds provided by The
Coca-Cola Company. Suppliers must furnish a copy of this
accounting to The Coca-Cola Company upon request.


Protecting Information

Suppliers should protect the confidential information of The
Coca-Cola Company. Suppliers who have been given access
to confidential information as part of the business relationship
should not share this information with anyone unless authorized
to do so by The Coca-Cola Company. Suppliers should not
trade in securities, or encourage others to do so, based on
confidential information received from The Coca-Cola Company.
If a supplier believes it has been given access to The Coca-Cola
Company’s confidential information in error, the supplier should
immediately notify its contact at the Company and refrain from
further distribution of the information.


Similarly, a supplier should not share with anyone at The
Coca-Cola Company information related to any other company
if the supplier is under a contractual or legal obligation not to
share the information.


Reporting Potential Misconduct

Suppliers who believe that an employee of The Coca-Cola
Company, or anyone acting on behalf of The Coca-Cola
Company, has engaged in illegal or otherwise improper
conduct, should report the matter to the Company. The
supplier can contact the employee’s manager or The
Coca-Cola Company Ethics & Compliance Office at
+1-404-676-5579 or compliance@na.ko.com, or use the
Company’s EthicsLine reporting service at www.KOethics.com,
or call toll-free using the access codes that can be found on
the EthicsLine website. A supplier’s relationship with The
Coca-Cola Company will not be affected by an honest report
of potential misconduct.
