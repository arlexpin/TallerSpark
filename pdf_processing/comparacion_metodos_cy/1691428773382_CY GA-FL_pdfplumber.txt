driver is responsible for re-sealing the trailer after each pickup/drop on a multi-stop shipment. In the event a shipment that

intact then (i) the Carrier shall be liable for any shortage or damage claims with respect to such shipment and (ii) the shipper
shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to deem the entire shipment damaged, adulterated/contaminated and
unsalvageable, without the need for any inspection and the Carrier shall be liable for the full value of the shipment. Carrier is

compliance with any comparable requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other states, where applicable. CARRIER

information CARRIER provides to BROKER, including information regarding the drivers transporting shipments. CARRIER shall indemnify,
defend, and hold BROKER and its affiliates harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, actions and expenses
