charges must appear on a revised confirmation sheet signed by the BROKER. CARRIER must include signed copy of the shipper's bill of
lading and any other proof of delivery with invoice to BROKER. Rates, except as specifically designated above, are inclusive of any fuel

the scope of CARRIER’s operations, including, but not limited to: Statewide Truck and Bus Regulations, Transport Refrigeration Unit (TRU)
Regulations, Tractor-Trailer Greenhouse (GHG) Gas Regulations, and Drayage Truck Regulations. CARRIER also warrants that it is in
compliance with any comparable requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other states, where applicable. CARRIER
shall be responsible for any fines imposed on BROKER and/or shipper resulting from noncompliance.


CARRIER hereby confirms that it maintains applicable and valid insurance without exclusions that would prevent coverage for the items listed
above. CARRIER has at least $100,000.00 in cargo insurance and $1,000,000.00 in automobile liability coverage. CARRIER further confirms
that in transporting the shipment described hereinabove, it will comply with all U.S. DOT and FDA regulations applicable to its operations while

CARRIER agrees to the attached requirements from the shipper, if any.


**ALL LOADS ARE SUBJECT TO ELECTRONIC TRACKING**


By accepting this shipment, CARRIER agrees that it has obtained a written agreement from each driver transporting a shipment tendered by
BROKER to CARRIER pursuant to the Agreement in which each driver provides all necessary consents to (i) receiving text messages and/or
phone calls from or on behalf of BROKER and (ii) allowing BROKER or its vendor to track such driver’s location while transporting such
shipment. CARRIER shall comply with all applicable laws relating to the collection, use, storage, retention, disclosure, and disposal of any
information CARRIER provides to BROKER, including information regarding the drivers transporting shipments. CARRIER shall indemnify,
defend, and hold BROKER and its affiliates harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, actions and expenses
