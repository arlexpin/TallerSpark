driver is responsible for re-sealing the trailer after each pickup/drop on a multi-stop shipment. In the event a shipment that
was sealed at origin or after each additional pickup/drop arrives at the destination with a tampered seal or without the seal
intact then (i) the Carrier shall be liable for any shortage or damage claims with respect to such shipment and (ii) the shipper
shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to deem the entire shipment damaged, adulterated/contaminated and
unsalvageable, without the need for any inspection and the Carrier shall be liable for the full value of the shipment. Carrier is
required to weigh shipment within 50 miles of departing each shipper. If carrier fails to weigh shipment within 50 miles of

facial coverings to the extent required by laws or facilities. **Carrier must be in full compliance with the Food Safety**

#### Terms and Conditions

The Broker-Carrier Agreement or Carrier Agreement (in each case, the “Agreement”) between Coyote Logistics, LLC, a Licensed Property
Broker - USDOT # 2236410, and GTT Freight Corp is amended by the verbal agreement between Danny Matkovic of Coyote Logistics, LLC
hereafter referred to as BROKER, and Camilo Ramirez of GTT Freight Corp hereafter referred to as CARRIER, dated 08/16/2023.


This confirmation is subject to the terms of the Agreement and this document constitutes an amendment thereto. If the CARRIER has not
signed the Agreement, then the rate shown above is the agreed individually negotiated rate and no other rate shall apply including any carrier
tariff rate or terms.


THIS LOAD SHALL NOT BE DOUBLE BROKERED. No additional charges not listed above may be added by the CARRIER. Any additional
charges must appear on a revised confirmation sheet signed by the BROKER. CARRIER must include signed copy of the shipper's bill of
lading and any other proof of delivery with invoice to BROKER. Rates, except as specifically designated above, are inclusive of any fuel
surcharge. CARRIER certifies that it is in compliance with all requirements of the California Air Resources Board (CARB) that are applicable to
the scope of CARRIER’s operations, including, but not limited to: Statewide Truck and Bus Regulations, Transport Refrigeration Unit (TRU)
Regulations, Tractor-Trailer Greenhouse (GHG) Gas Regulations, and Drayage Truck Regulations. CARRIER also warrants that it is in
compliance with any comparable requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other states, where applicable. CARRIER
shall be responsible for any fines imposed on BROKER and/or shipper resulting from noncompliance.


CARRIER hereby confirms that it maintains applicable and valid insurance without exclusions that would prevent coverage for the items listed
above. CARRIER has at least $100,000.00 in cargo insurance and $1,000,000.00 in automobile liability coverage. CARRIER further confirms
that in transporting the shipment described hereinabove, it will comply with all U.S. DOT and FDA regulations applicable to its operations while
transporting said shipment, including, but not limited to drivers' hours of service, and the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), if applicable.
CARRIER agrees to the attached requirements from the shipper, if any.


**ALL LOADS ARE SUBJECT TO ELECTRONIC TRACKING**


By accepting this shipment, CARRIER agrees that it has obtained a written agreement from each driver transporting a shipment tendered by
BROKER to CARRIER pursuant to the Agreement in which each driver provides all necessary consents to (i) receiving text messages and/or
phone calls from or on behalf of BROKER and (ii) allowing BROKER or its vendor to track such driver’s location while transporting such
shipment. CARRIER shall comply with all applicable laws relating to the collection, use, storage, retention, disclosure, and disposal of any
information CARRIER provides to BROKER, including information regarding the drivers transporting shipments. CARRIER shall indemnify,
defend, and hold BROKER and its affiliates harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, actions and expenses
(including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or in connection with CARRIER’s breach of this Section. This Section shall survive the expiration or
termination of the Agreement between BROKER and CARRIER.

# **ATTENTION!**

#### **IF PICKING UP A SHIPMENT OF BATTERIES, PLEASE READ THE BELOW AND SEE** **ATTACHED DOCUMENTATION.**

In order for the hazmat exemption to apply to this shipment, the load must be packaged according to

the DOT regulations for the hazmat exemption and blocked and braced and secured within the trailer. If

the load is not properly packaged or not properly secured within the trailer the exemption does not

apply and the load is considered hazmat- therefore the driver would need placards and certification.


Drivers- if for any reason you feel the load you are picking up does not comply with the hazmat

exemption, please call your Coyote representative immediately. It is the responsibility of the driver to

confirm product is secure within trailer.


Van only, must have ALL wood floors.


**HAZMAT EXEMPTION EXPLANATION**

49 CFR 173.159. As long as the shipper of lead acid or wet batteries complies with all the requirements
of the CFR, they are not subject to placarding the truck or having a driver with hazmat endorsement
on his/her CDL.

(e) Electric storage batteries containing electrolyte or corrosive battery fluid are not subject to the
requirements of this subchapter for transportation by highway or rail if all of the following requirements

are met:


(1) No other hazardous materials may be transported in the same vehicle;
(2) The batteries must be loaded or braced so as to prevent damage and short circuits in transit;
(3) Any other material loaded in the same vehicle must be blocked, braced, or otherwise
secured to prevent contact with or damage to the batteries; and

(4) The transport vehicle may not carry material shipped by any person other than the shipper

of the batteries.
